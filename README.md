# Paradox IP150 EVO panel tester

This project is a tester application that tests TCP/IP communication to/from a Paradox IP150 internet module using the software port (typically 10,000).  It is aimed at IP150 modules that are connected to Digiplex EVO panels, e.g. EVO48, EVO96 & EVO192.

The code is purely aimed at testing various panel commands and contains little to no error checking.

## Requirements

Paradox IP150 internet module (*below* version v4.0)
Paradox EVO control panel (EVO48, EVO96 & EVO192)

EVO HD control panels have not yet been tested.
